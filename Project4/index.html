        <h2>Here's a timeline of his Life..</h2>
        <p>
          Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, a very simple person who lived an
          unpretentious lifestyle, had a keen interest in literature and wrote
          poems. He never married and always faced media himself for his
          failures, while allowing others to address his successes. He remained
          active till the very end and passed away while delivering a lecture at
          the IIM.
