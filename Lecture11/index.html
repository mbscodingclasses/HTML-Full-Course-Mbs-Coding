        <h2>Here's a time-line of his Life..</h2>
        <p>
          A very simple person who lived an unpretentious lifestyle. He had a
          keen interest in literature and wrote poems. He never married. He
          always faced media himself for his failures while let others address
          for the success. He remained active till the very end. He died while
          delivering a lecture at the IIM.

            Dream is not that which you see while sleeping, it is something that
            does not let you sleep.
          </li>
          <li>If you want to shine like a sun, first burn like a sun.</li>
          <li>Excellence happens not by accident. It is a process.</li>
          <li>
            Donâ€™t take rest after your first victory because if you fail in
            second, more lips are waiting to say that your first victory was
            just luck.
          </li>
        </ol>
